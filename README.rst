What is TPL Override?
#####################

TPL Override is a simple PHP application designed for site owners and coders
that utlize the WHMCS Billing Software system.  TPL Override permits users to
create custom template files and store them in a separate folder from the rest
of the template files used by WHMCS.  At execution, if a template file is found
in the custom template folder, it's code is used in place of the code from the
WHMCS template file.

TPL Override is an open source project and accepts contributions of code
and documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form

the `TPL Override repository

Issues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation
error in TPL Override then please check a few things first:

- There is not already an open Issue
- The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for
  closed Issues)
- Is it something really obvious that you fix it yourself?

Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull
Request, which is done by "Forking" the main repository and committing to your
own copy. This will require you to use the version control system called Git.
