Installing TPL Override
-----------------------
Installing TPL Override is fairly straight forward and easy to do, please follow these simple instructions:

1. Open your favorite FTP program and upload the 'modules' folder to your WHMCS root directory.
2. Log into your WHMCS Admin Control Panel and go to Setup > Addon Modules.
3. Find the row that corresponds to TPL Override and click Activate.
4. Download any *.tpl files from your selected WHMCS template folder that you wish to customize.
5. Edit locally the files to your satisfaction.
6. Upload the modified *.tpl files to this folder off of your WHMCS root: /modules/addons/tpl_override/tpl.  Be sure not to rename the file.

That's it - your customized *.tpl files should now be overwriting the regular template files on the fly!
